## Pascal's Triangle Function

The `pascal_triangle` function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a list of lists representing Pascal's Triangle up to the `n`th row. The function handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to 0 by returning an empty list.

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    """
    Generate Pascal's Triangle up to the nth row.

    Args:
    - n: Integer representing the number of rows to generate.

    Returns:
    - List of lists representing Pascal's Triangle.
    """

    return triangle
